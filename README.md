# URBAN Garden
## Gardenless Greenery for the Concrete Jungle 

### WHAT? 
We bring you a site with all the information you need to find the perfect plants for your home, whether that be in the garden, on the window sill, or as part of a roof garden.  
- Database of a wide variety of plants 
- Ability to search on multiple criteria, including maintenance level and toxicity to pets
- Opportunity to create a user and login 
- Store your favourite plants to refer back to whenever you log in
- Create a to-do list of all the plant-related tasks you need to do (or your shopping list - whatever you want!)
- Add to our database! Let us know about any wonderful plants you find!

### WHY? 
We want to help turn the major cities in the UK green.  Air pollution is becoming an increasing issue in major cities, and we aim to combat that.  Not only are plants good for the environment, they also promote wellbeing and improve air quality in the home.
